# The idea
I just had the idea, to make my own IRC server software, that shold be easily managable via a web interface.
Also there should be a version for SaaS (Software as a Service) providers, that should be easy to manage and accessible via an API. This part will be allowed to be commercially used, as long as I get supported during development by companies using this software.

## The plan
There is no plan yet. I'll plan this further when I've got the base knowledge about how IRC works behind the scenes. Also I still have to find a good enough programming language to plan this further. Maybe this will be written in Rust.
