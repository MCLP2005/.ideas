# Games that will be open source and free to use

## List
* Marketplace simulator
* Maybe something with voxels

## Explanations
### Marketplace simulator
This should behave like the Steam marketplace, but it should be free of charge.  
There could be DLCs that will cost money. So this might be a little bit not so free.
Though the DLCs will be more like licensed content packs from other games or the real world (This thing next to all the screens).
People should have the option for multiplayer, which can be either hosted from the game directly or even a seperate server.
